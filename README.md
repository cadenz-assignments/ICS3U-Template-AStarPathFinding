## How to use

### If you are using replit
1. Open replit.
2. Create a new repl. Click the button where it says `Import from GitHub`
3. In the box that says `GitHub URL` paste in `https://github.com/cadenz-assignments/ICS3U-Template-AStarPathFinding` and click the blue `Import from GitHub`.
4. It is going to take a little bit to clone the repository to replit. After it finishes, it will have a popup to the right of the code where it asks you to select a language and a start command. It should default to `Node JS` and `npm start`. If it is not that, change it to that.
5. You should be all good and setup!

### If you are not using replit
1. Clone this github repository
2. Once thats done, do `npm install` inside the newly cloned folder.
3. You should be good to go. Use `npm start` to run the code.
